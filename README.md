### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Max.

### About me

I have been studying Front-End development for over a year with great success. During this time, I
have created numerous projects utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
TypeScript, and React in various domains. Additionally, I have gained valuable experience working
in teams, even serving as a Team Leader on some projects.
My skill set includes strong analytical abilities, resilience to stress, attention to detail, and a
commitment to ongoing professional development.
